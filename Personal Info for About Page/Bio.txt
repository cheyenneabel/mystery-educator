My name is William Fairfield. I currently live in Crawfordsville Indiana. My skills and interests are extremely varried. I am currently studying to become a full stack java developer. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more! Some of the things that I like to do in my free time include riding my motorcycle, playing video games, and collecting geodes.

My name is Cheyenne Abel. I received my BFA in Dance from The Ohio State University in 2013. My time spent both as a dancer and working in the restaurant industry include adaptability, remaining calm under pressure, improvisation, and collaboration. I am transitioning into a Software Development role after completing We Can Code IT Bootcamp. Currently gaining hands-on project experience building both the front-end and back-end of web apps.
