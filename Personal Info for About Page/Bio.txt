My name is William Fairfield. I currently live in Crawfordsville Indiana. My skills and interests are extremely varried. I am currently studying to become a full stack java developer. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more! Some of the things that I like to do in my free time include riding my motorcycle, playing video games, and collecting geodes.
